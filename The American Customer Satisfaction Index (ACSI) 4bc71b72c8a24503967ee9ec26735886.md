# The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI)

---

In today's highly competitive business landscape, understanding customer satisfaction is crucial for the success of any organization. It is a key driver of customer loyalty, brand reputation, and overall business performance, prompting organizations across various industries to invest heavily in measuring and improving customer satisfaction.

One organization that has emerged as a leader in this field is The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI), which annually collects survey data from some 400,000 consumers across the United States for over 50 consumer industries and more than 400 companies.

To contribute to the growing body of knowledge on customer satisfaction and help businesses improve their customer satisfaction levels, this project analyzes a sample of survey data collected by the ACSI in 2015. The goal is to explore customers' perceptions of their experiences with individual companies in the Processed Food, Commercial Airlines, Internet Service Providers, and Commercial Banks Industries, identifying trends and patterns that can inform decisions to gain a competitive advantage and ultimately drive business success.
